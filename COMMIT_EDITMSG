Refactor error handling and cleanup tour component

Updated unauthorizedInterceptor to delegate error handling to UserAuthenticationStore. Simplified error handling in the properties-dashboard component and main-menu component by making method calls optional. Removed redundant "Don't Show Again" buttons from tour steps.
